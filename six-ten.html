		<h3>First seat auction:</h3>
			<p>On January 14, 2010, Carowinds launched a "First Rider Auction" in which people from anywhere in the world would bid against each other in order to be one of the first public riders on Intimidator, with ninety–six seats being made available to bid on. The bidders that fell in the top 96 were given the opportunity to be the first public riders on Intimidator on March 27, 2010, before the ride opened to the general public. All money raised during the auction went to the Dale Earnhardt Foundation. The highest bid for a single seat was US$500.</p>

			<br><strong>Robert Marshall: </strong>This is an awesome ride. They are very efficient getting people on and off the ride
			<br>
			<br><strong>Jacob Kuhn: </strong>One of the best rides at the park. The afterburn is okay, like the nighthawk, love the fury, but intimidator beats them all.
			<br>
			<br><strong>Connor Wood: </strong>The sequel to this is Intimidator 305 at King's Dominion. This coaster goes 75, Intimidator 305 goes 90 and drops from 305ft.
			<br>
			<br><strong>Elijah Resuello: </strong>it was scary, i rode with a friend and he pranked me saying its over having my eyes closed, i opened them at the top of a dip. but it was smooth and very fun.

			<center><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ToJ7sZYg9go/maxresdefault.jpg"width="500" align="middle"/></center>
			<p><strong>Goliath is a steel roller coaster made by Giovanola of Switzerland. The hypercoaster is located in the Colossus County Fair area of Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California and is promoted with a sub-tropical theme that is characterized by ruins of the ancient Mayan civilization. The ride is nearly identical to Titan at Six Flags Over Texas. Its differences from its Six Flags twin is that Goliath lacks the 540-degree upward helix on Titan prior to the mid-course brake run (Goliath simply banks left to the brake run instead) and Goliath is also slightly shorter than Titan.</strong></p>

			<br><strong>Jack McQuaid: </strong>In the top three for me in the park! The forces and drop and tunnel! And I even started to grey out on that final turn! Only problem (maybe my fault) I tried to Dab for the picture but the was to much force and I got pulled down! AMAZING RIDE THOUGH!
			<br>
			<br><strong>Stacie Fuller: </strong>This ride was super scary. My friend persuaded me to get on this and I don't regret it. The best ride I have ever been on!
			<br>
			<br><strong>Blake Partridge: </strong>A great ride.  The first drop is epic and really memorable.  The pause in the middle and then dipping left just seals the deal.  Go ride this.
			<br>
			<br><strong>Jose Amaral J: </strong>The line can get pretty long and boring specially in a hot day if you get lucky there are some spots where they have water mist overhead. This ride is very powerful in many ways! The drop is insane and picks up good speed and the turns and loops are awesome. At one area close to the end of the ride the track starts to spiral and go in circles and it pulls some strong G's that people say that they feel like they might black-out. Its worth waiting in line.

			<p><strong>Drachen Fire was an Arrow Dynamics roller coaster that operated from 1992 to 1998 at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, in Williamsburg, Virginia. It featured electric-blue track and silver supports, and was located in the Oktoberfest portion of the park, behind the Big Bad Wolf and Das Festhaus. The tagline for the ride was "Feel the Heat."The ride had three separate trains, featuring seven cars each, with each car holding passengers arranged two by two. The cars were red, with grey seats, and featured red trim lights illuminated the trains at night.Upon opening, the ride featured a 150 foot tall lift hill, six inversions, and a zero-gravity camel-back hump element. The ride was shut down in the middle of the 1998 season following a history of low ridership, and complaints of roughness.</strong></p>

			<br><strong>Nick Constantino: </strong>Busch Gardens is an amazing theme park that all ages will enjoy!  It is very clean and well kept.  The staff is very welcoming making it a pleasure to be there.  The entire park is maintained beautifully.  The roller coasters will give you the rush of your life.  I highly suggest visiting this theme park, you will not be disappointed.
			<br>
			<br><strong>Kate Smith: </strong>Beautiful park, lots of rides for all ages, friendly staff. We've been going here for years and love to come back once or twice a year. Just took the ultimate coaster tour and HIGHLY recommend it. Our guide, Steve, was full of information and we learned a lot. Nice twist on a park you're already familiar with to learn some behind-the-scenes tips and information. Plus you get to walk around at the top of Griffon before the park opens and be the first riders of the day.
			<br>
			<br><strong>Dale Arney: </strong>It's a clean park with plenty of fun to be had. Don't expect lots of animals like in Tampa, but you won't be disappointed. The rides are very good, the shows are okay, the food is actually good (try the BBQ), and the little kids have plenty to do too.
			<br>
			<br><strong>Payton Canipe: </strong>This was one of the best parks i have ever been to, it had some of the best roller coasters and rides. I love busch gardens, and i think everyone should go here at least once for an amazing vacation.

		<center><h2><strong>Number 6: Superman-the Escape</strong></h2></center>
			<center><img src="http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/41116958.jpg"width="500" align="middle"/></center>
			<p><strong> Superman The Escape was originally intended to open in 1996.  Due to problems, it was never open to the public until the 1997 season.  There was a preview for season pass holders in the fall of 1996. For the 2011 season, Superman The Escape was transformed into Superman: Escape from Krypton. The most significant change was positioning riders to face backwards so they now look towards the ground rather than the sky on the vertical track.</strong></p>

			<br><strong>Michael Weissman: </strong>It's fast! Docking one star because there should be a single rider line. With only one car running, the line can take a whileeee
			<br>
			<br><strong>Jack McQuaid: </strong>ABSOLUTELY AMAZINGLY! The backwards launch, and the awesome hang time, and the way back down! The only thing I remember before I took off is an employee waving "bye" too me! Awesome!
			<br>
			<br><strong>Estevan Sanz: </strong>Will be nice if you can activate a loop mode or something... xD BTW you can get some coupons and discounts on my profile. Hope it helps!
			<br>
			<br><strong>Alex Lo: </strong>Blink, and this ride is over. Not worth waiting in too long of a line for.
