					<center><img src="http://www.themeparkcritic.com/Uploads/39/MF.jpg"/></center>
					<p><strong>Millennium Force is a steel roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. Millennium broke six world records and was the world's first Giga Coaster (a type of roller coaster with a height or drop that ranges from 300 feet (91 m) to 399 feet (122 m) and completes a full circuit), when completed in 2000. It was briefly the tallest and fastest in the world until Steel Dragon 2000 opened later the same year. It was the first roller coaster to use a cable lift system rather than a traditional chain lift. The coaster has a 310 ft (94 m), 45-degree lift hill with a 300 ft (91 m) drop and features two tunnels, three overbanked turns, and four hills. It has a top speed of 93 mph (150 km/h).Since its debut, Millennium Force has been voted the number one steel roller coaster ten times in Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Awards. Its lowest ranking in the poll has been two, a position that it has swapped with Superman the Ride (formerly Bizarro) numerous times since 2001. Although Millennium Force has been surpassed in height and speed, it remains one of the tallest and fastest in the world.</strong></p>

					<h3>Reviews (overall 4.8 stars)</h4>
						<p><strong>Eric Stankovitz:</strong> 
						<br>If I could give out 10 stars, I would for this magnificent piece of steel. Beautifully designed and crafted and has an incredible view. The drop is insane overlooking the lake and the rest of the ride lives up to all the hype as one of the best coasters in the world. Amazing air time and speed throughout the ride and keeps the adrenaline pumping like crazy. Highly recommended even with a long line. Loved the front row. A++++++++++++
						<br><strong>Jeremy Daniels:</strong>
						<br>Best coaster in the park.
						<br>Best coaster in the state.
						<br>Best coaster in the United States.
						<br>Best coaster in the world. Possibly.
						<br>Maybe. Maybe not.
						<br>But I love it.
						<br><strong>Alec Fern:</strong>
						<br>Thrilling, Fast, Tall, and amazing. Riding this coaster shows you the meaning of adrenaline. This will get your blood FLOWING, dropping 305ft and looking down will make you pray and hope you don't go down. But, once you start that drop. It all ends... Going 93mph this ride is thrilling and amazing!
						<br><strong>Jon Autry:</strong>
						<br>Best roller coaster I have ever ridden - hands down. This ride is smooth, long, and incredibly fast. When we disembarked, our mouths were dry from screaming and the rush of air in our faces. Thrill seekers will NOT be disappointed with this ride!
