						<br><strong>Jack McQuaid: </strong>In its own way, it's the best ride in the park. My alltime favorites are Smiler and Nemesis, but Oblivion was so different, it was my 3rd fav, smiler being one and nemesis being two. 
						<br>I recommend front row! Which there's a one in two chance you'll get it, there's only two rows anyway
						<br>180 foot drop
						<br>Comfy seats.
						<br>No headbangs.
						<br>68 mph!
						<br>
						<br><strong>Daniel Cupples: </strong>This is the greatest example of simple but thrilling coaster, up you go and down in the best way possible.
						<br>
						<br><strong>Scott Allison: </strong>Short and sweet ride that always gives me Tourette's when you drop into the hole from the lift hill.
						<br>
						<br><strong>Harry Davies: </strong>Thrilling and intense roller coaster - the first of it's kind.

						<br><strong>Vinnie McMahon: </strong>This is the BEST coaster I've ever been on, and I've been on a lot. As someone else said, ride it at night, back seat (preferably on the left), and prepare for the ride of your life. Feels like a runaway train! 
						<br>
						<br><strong>George Miller: </strong>For the most intense, best ride, ride it at night and sit in the last seat on the left side. Incredible.
						<br>
						<br><strong>Zamantha Brown: </strong>One of the best wooden roller coasters alive. 
						<br>
						<br><strong>Tyler Schauss: </strong>Best Rollercoaster ever made!

					<p><strong>Superman-Ride of Steel is a steel roller coaster located at Six Flags America amusement park near Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Ride of Steel is an identical model located at Darien Lake amusement park in Darien, New York. Both are hypercoasters reaching heights above 200 feet (61 m), and were manufactured by Intamin. The installation at Darien Lake opened to the public on May 15, 1999, and the replica at Six Flags America opened a year later on May 13, 2000. Six Flags New England's Superman the Ride roller coaster was previously known as "Superman-Ride of Steel" prior to 2009, but it features a significantly different layout.</strong></p>

						<br><strong>Ben Gribbon: </strong>Pretty much what a roller coaster should be: long, tall, fast, and sturdy.
						<br>
						<br><strong>Mathias: </strong>Amazing rollercoaster! A really big drop and some high speed action! Took it a few times and concluded that it's most fun to sit all the way in the back.
						<br>
						<br><strong>CoasterGlitch: </strong>Most underrated coaster Ive ever on! Yeah the layout is kinda boring but the amazing airtime makes up for it! I highly recommend.

					<p><strong>Top Thrill Dragster is a steel accelerator roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. It was the sixteenth roller coaster built at the park since the Blue Streak in 1964. When built in 2003, it was the first full circuit roller coaster to exceed 400 feet (120 m) in height, and was the tallest roller coaster in the world, before being surpassed by Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in May 2005. Top Thrill Dragster, along with Kingda Ka, are the only strata coasters in existence. </strong></p>
					<h3>Records:</h3>
					<p>
					<br>When Top Thrill Dragster debuted, it set four new records:
					<br>World's tallest complete circuit roller coaster
					<br>World's tallest roller coaster
					<br>World's tallest roller coaster drop
					<br>World's fastest roller coaster

						<br>Kailyn Rittenberryin: Personally a fantastic ride but for the people who are wanting to go but seem to be terrified to do so, first off; Its a 16 second ride so in reality if you do ride and hate it (which most people do not) youve wasted only 16 second of your life and thats okay! at least you can say you did it! love the ride, and love the park (: have fun
						<br>
						<br>Eric Stankovitz: At my home park, we have the taller brother Kingda Ka. But the original stands up to all the hype. It may be a little shorter in height, but it still gives the insane adrenaline pumping ride that Ka does. There's nothing like shooting out at over 100 mph and climbing 400 feet in less than a few seconds. A must ride for any coaster fan.
						<br>
						<br>Vinnie McMahon: The acceleration is RIDICULOUS. If only the ride was longer... still worth a try, no doubt.
						<br>
						<br>Lisa Kotcher: At a blasting 120 mph, Top Thrill Dragster is a must do! I went to Cedar Point yesterday and I rode this ride 4 times! It was my first time on the ride yesterday and I can see why it is a Cedar Point classic. I bought the fast lane plus and I dodged the line so quickly! After you board the train (I suggest being in rows 2 or 1, you get the best view of the park) is the scariest part of the ride: the launch. You wait for 16 seconds and suddenly you see 3 yellow lights and 1 green light flash and your off! At 120 mph you climb up the 420 ft hill, do a 90 degree twist and suddenly your up 420 ft above earth! Start screaming because your about to go down a 400 ft drop, into another 90 degree turn and finally you've crossed the finish line! Your happy that it's over but you want to ride it again and again! Looking for the best ride in the park? Well you've come to the right place, because Top Thrill Dragster is a must do!

			<center><h2><strong>Number 1: Millenium Force</strong></h2></center>
					<center><img src="http://www.themeparkcritic.com/Uploads/39/MF.jpg"width="500" align="middle"class="ffimage"/></center>
					<p><strong>Millennium Force is a steel roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. Millennium broke six world records and was the world's first Giga Coaster (a type of roller coaster with a height or drop that ranges from 300 feet (91 m) to 399 feet (122 m) and completes a full circuit), when completed in 2000. It was briefly the tallest and fastest in the world until Steel Dragon 2000 opened later the same year. It was the first roller coaster to use a cable lift system rather than a traditional chain lift. The coaster has a 310 ft (94 m), 45-degree lift hill with a 300 ft (91 m) drop and features two tunnels, three overbanked turns, and four hills. It has a top speed of 93 mph (150 km/h).Since its debut, Millennium Force has been voted the number one steel roller coaster ten times in Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Awards. Its lowest ranking in the poll has been two, a position that it has swapped with Superman the Ride (formerly Bizarro) numerous times since 2001. Although Millennium Force has been surpassed in height and speed, it remains one of the tallest and fastest in the world.</strong></p>
					
					
  					<h3>Records</h3>

						<p><strong>Eric Stankovitz:</strong> 
						<br>If I could give out 10 stars, I would for this magnificent piece of steel. Beautifully designed and crafted and has an incredible view. The drop is insane overlooking the lake and the rest of the ride lives up to all the hype as one of the best coasters in the world. Amazing air time and speed throughout the ride and keeps the adrenaline pumping like crazy. Highly recommended even with a long line. Loved the front row. A++++++++++++
						<br>
						<br><strong>Jeremy Daniels:</strong>
						<br>Best coaster in the park.
						<br>Best coaster in the state.
						<br>Best coaster in the United States.
						<br>Best coaster in the world. Possibly.
						<br>Maybe. Maybe not.
						<br>But I love it.
						<br>
						<br><strong>Alec Fern:</strong>
						<br>Thrilling, Fast, Tall, and amazing. Riding this coaster shows you the meaning of adrenaline. This will get your blood FLOWING, dropping 305ft and looking down will make you pray and hope you don't go down. But, once you start that drop. It all ends... Going 93mph this ride is thrilling and amazing!
						<br>
						<br><strong>Jon Autry:</strong>
						<br>Best roller coaster I have ever ridden - hands down. This ride is smooth, long, and incredibly fast. When we disembarked, our mouths were dry from screaming and the rush of air in our faces. Thrill seekers will NOT be disappointed with this ride!
