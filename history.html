			<h2 class="center">History</h2>
				<p>The oldest roller coasters are known as Russian mountains also known as Russian ice slides. The slides were generally 20-24 meters tall, consisted of 50 degree drops and were reinforced by wooden supports. Many historians believe that the first modern roller coaster was built by the French. The Promenades Aeriennes in Parc Baujon and the Les Montagnes Russes Ã  Belleville (The Russian Mountains of Belleville) were both constructed in Paris in 1817 and both featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds.</p>

				<p>In 1827, a mining company in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania constructed the Mauch Chunk gravity railroad, an 8.7-mile (14.0 km) downhill track used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk (now known as Jim Thorpe), Pennsylvania. By the 1850s, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was providing rides to thrill-seekers for 50 cents a ride. Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.</p>

				<p>Opening in 1901, there was one of the first looping roller coaster in Coney Island. It was made of steel and had a small loop that accompanied the ride. It came and went, by the name of Loop the Loop. </p>

				<p>During 1934, a new attraction arrives at Cedar Point. It's name, The Tumbling Bug. It's made of steel and located in Cedar Point, an amusement park near Lake Erie. It's an example of many rides we see today as "kiddie rides".</p>

				<p>In the 2000's, Cedar Point built a coaster that still stands today as the Top Thrill Dragster. It was made of steel to maintain it's speed and was the tallest of all time, until Kingda Ka came along.</p>

				<p>Kingda Ka was a steel coaster that was added to Six Flags Great Adventure Park in 2005. It was built to be the tallest and fastest coaster in the world, out ranking Top Thrill Dragster.</p>

				<p>In May 2012, a new coaster arrives to the Six Flag world. It goes by the name X Flight, and is made of steel. It's one ride that no longer holds you into your seat, but allows your feet to dangle. It includes drops and spins.</p>
