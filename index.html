			<h2>History</h2>
				<p>The oldest roller coasters are known as Russian mountains also known as Russian ice slides. The slides were generally 20-24 meters tall, consisted of 50 degree drops and were reinforced by wooden supports. Many historians believe that the first modern roller coaster was built by the French. The Promenades Aeriennes in Parc Baujon and the Les Montagnes Russes à Belleville (The Russian Mountains of Belleville) were both constructed in Paris in 1817 and both featured wheeled cars securely locked to the track, guide rails to keep them on course, and higher speeds.</p>

				<p>In 1827, a mining company in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania constructed the Mauch Chunk gravity railroad, an 8.7-mile (14.0 km) downhill track used to deliver coal to Mauch Chunk (now known as Jim Thorpe), Pennsylvania.[4] By the 1850s, the "Gravity Road" (as it became known) was providing rides to thrill-seekers for 50 cents a ride. Railway companies used similar tracks to provide amusement on days when ridership was low.</p>
